# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in Vue.js/React Components
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with Vue.js or React:  Tailwind classes failing to apply correctly due to incorrect usage within component structures.

The `bug.vue` file shows the problematic code, where Tailwind classes are applied incorrectly, leading to missing styles.  The `bugSolution.vue` file presents the corrected code, demonstrating the proper way to integrate Tailwind classes for correct rendering.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm run serve` (assuming a suitable build setup).
4. Observe the missing styles in the initial rendering, highlighting the problem.
5. Compare with the solution in `bugSolution.vue` to understand the correction.

## Solution
The solution emphasizes the correct placement and usage of Tailwind directives within the component's template structure or JSX.
