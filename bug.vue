This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.  The issue stems from incorrect usage of Tailwind directives within the framework's component structure.  Specifically, attempting to use Tailwind classes directly on a root-level component or in a place where Tailwind's compiler can't interpret them correctly. For instance, applying classes to a functional component's return value instead of a template.
